<Description>PRUFEI (Protection for Recipes Using Favorite and Equipped Items) stops you accidentally breaking-down favorite and equipped items when using recipes in compatible mods. By itself this mod will have no effect, it only enables the *possibility* of breakdown recipes that protect items. This mod would have been impossible without major assistance from 'mrpwn' and 'IsharaMeradin' (who are not responsible for any bugs that may remain).
